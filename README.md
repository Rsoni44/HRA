Introduction
A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood.
The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of heart attack.
